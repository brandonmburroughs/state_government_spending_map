# State Government Spending Map

I created this bar chart/map visualizations using D3.  This is one of my first larger D3 projects, so it's a bit messy and still needs to be cleaned up.

I used the following examples to help build this visualization:
* [Map](https://vida.io/gists/vfP7KiHLfDbnDWBsX)
* [Bar chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304)
* [Wrapping bar chart labels](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7555321)
